    <p>Ideas written here about <em>how to do things</em>&nbsp;are developed and written a really long time ago.</p>
    <p>But the practical needs are not always obvious and often cannot be defined in certain and unique terms. Our objective here is not to repeat all this vast body of information but to develop a systematic approach to make practical and effective use of it.</p>
    <p>This wouldn't be needed if the marketing hadn't come up with a myriad of techniques, procedures, literature descriptions, guides, and practices on the subject of how to do things that cause information overpopulation. Many of the information is given by so-called motivational speakers that have only informal understanding. As if everyone keeps shouting <strong>just do it</strong>, but nobody seems to be interested in saying anything about the steps needed to "do it". And because of all of that, the pursuits of self-help and personal development mostly ends in repeating psychological pain and helplesness.</p>
    <p>We will try to provide some of the missing parts. <strong>We are not</strong> the world authority on neither philosophy or cognitive therapy but we know a decent amount about both. It is an unimaginably big subject.</p>
    <p>It is our hope to provide digression from conceptual prisons and compulsive thinking that seems to be so common in modern time.<br/>Our goal is to provide some of the insights into our natural responses.</p>
